      <p><h3>

        Gaushala samiti is one of the largest Gaurakshashala of Desi cows in India. We protect, feed & shelter ailing, starving, destitute and stray Desi Cows, the majority of which are abandoned by their owners or saved from butchers. Most of these Gauvansh are milk barren. These cows are brought to our Gaushala from tough conditions. All these cows are fed, sheltered, and looked after. Hundreds of Gausewaks work round the clock to look after them. This Gaushala is run and managed by saints. We do not sell milk or milk products.

    <h2>ADOPT A COW</h2>
    <p><h3>
        Once a cow grows old and stops giving milk, their (its) owner disowns them because they are of no use to them. Thousands of such innocent cows are left on the street without a home. Many of these are just aged, injured, or abandoned. Some of these cows fall prey to the hands of butchers. Others are deeply starved and move from one place to another in search of food bearing the brunt of weather. These cows are deeply insulted, canned, and even pelted with stones. Some of these even meet with fatal accidents, others groan in pain due to severe injuries waiting for medical attention. The life of these cows becomes miserable.

    <h2>BENEFITS OF COW</h2>
    <p><h3>
        Know the incredible benefits of cow
The cow is a symbol of the divine bounty of earth. Ayurveda understands that some physical and emotional health crises cannot be healed by diet and herbs alone. They need the deeper and subtler healing of these types of Vedic ritual ceremonies to clear astrological past karma. The holy cow again offers its bounty by providing the ingredients in the Panchamrita, or blessed drink, that is distributed after the ceremony.

Panchamrita translates as “Sacred Ambrosia” or “Nectar of the Gods” and is made up of 5 items – Milk, Yogurt, Ghee, Honey and Sugar. By drinking this sweet Prasadam, one is infused with the divine energy created during the puja and is healed.
